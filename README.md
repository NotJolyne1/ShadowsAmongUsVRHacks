# How do I use this menu?
1. Go to https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=requirements and install MelonLoader for windows
2. Open MelonLoader and select Among Us 3D and/or Among Us 3D: VR
3. It is recommended to select version 6.6 but should work on others
4. Click install and wait a bit then move the ShadowsPublicMenu.dll (Obtainable in the GitHub releases tab) file into the mods section
5. Start your game, it may take a bit on the first launch but will work


# What do I do after starting my game?
When you have started your game, you should see the menu
It consists of toggle buttons, normal buttons, player buttons, and a FPS and room code display thing on the top middle of your screen
Buttons with (H) inside means the mod is Host Only, you can only use these as the host
Buttons with (3D) mean they can only be used on Among Us 3D, not VR
To select a player, use the arrow buttons on the player section until the player name is who you want to target
If something does not work, go to your console and copy the error(s) and send them to my Discord server or GitHub issues


# Will I get banned?
As of now, the menu is undetected and will not get you banned as long as you don't abuse these mods to hurt the game and the players, it will stay like this.


# Is this a virus?
No, the menu is open sourced so you may go through and check the files.
